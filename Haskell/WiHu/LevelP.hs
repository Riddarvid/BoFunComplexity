--Idea: preserve higher-level combinators such as majority in the graph.
--maj/count greater or equal n has the nice property (like and, or, xor) that
--it's commassoc.
--That means the list of arguments can be represented as a bag.
--Special case: I assume each variable is present only once.

--Algorithm: for each isomorphically distinct var, try evaluating it and
--normalize the resulting tree; memoize the expected cost.
--For maj3^2, the state is <= 3^3
--For maj3^3, it should be <= 27^3 - well within the range of practicality.
