This document is an overview over the Haskell code implementing different parts of complexity of boolean functions. 

* `All.hs`: main file, containing type classes and where you can run main, check5 and test27
* `Memo.hs`: memoization
* `Thin.hs`: Thinning
* `PolyCmp.hs`: comparing polynomials
* `Algor.hs`: step-by-step reconstruction of the algorithm generation.
* `BDD/Examples.hs`: some BDD examples of Boolean functions
* `BDD/Ordering.hs`: an ordering instance for BDDs
* `AllProp.hs`: some quickcheck tests of properties

Helper modules:

* `DSLsofMath`: folder with useful material regarding polynomials from the course [DSLsofMath](https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath) at Chalmers University of Technology
