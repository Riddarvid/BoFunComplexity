** fAC ~= same [x1,x2,x3] ==> same [x4,x5]
*** Four remaining polynomials:
ps5 :: S.Set (Poly Rational)
ps5 = genAlgThinMemoPoly 5 fAC
*** Polynomials paired with their respective decision trees
+ This is not shown in the paper, nor in the talk:

+ Note that the indices are "local": repeated Pick 1 just means pick
  the first _remaining_ variable repeatedly.
+ Also note that we just get one dectree for each polynomial - there
  are usually many dectrees with the same polynomial.
*** TODO Polynomials and all corresponding dectrees
+ It should be possible to define an instance which stores a
  polynomial p together with the full equivalence class of dectrees
  which map to that p.
+ Roughly:
res b = (res b, S.singleton (res b))
pic i (p0, ts0) (p1, ts1) = (pic i p0 p1, {pic i t0 t1 | t0 <- ts0, t1 <- ts1})
