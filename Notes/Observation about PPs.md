A 1-bit only has complexities described by single polynomials

## Smallest n and simplest example of a 2-piece PP

With 2 bits, four functions result in a 2-piece PP. Notably, all of them result in the same PP:

$$
p1(p) = 1 + p
$$

$$p2(p) = 2 - p$$

p1 wins when p < 0.5, p2 wins otherwise.

The functions with this complexity are:

00 0
01 0
10 1
11 0

## Smallest n and simplest example of a 3-piece PP

For functions with 3 bits, their complexities are at most described by 2-piece PPs.
